### Continued development

currently, I am learning javascript's frontend library React js. but first understanding how javascript works on the web is very important.

### Useful resources

- [stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me for changing the image when cliked. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) - this is great platform of every developer to understand how it works.
